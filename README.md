# littlewars

This repository contains the XML files for a digital critical edition of H. G. Wells's <em>Little Wars</em>, edited by Nigel Lepianka and Deanna Stover, and currently under review by <em>Scholarly Editing</em>.

The files were encoded according to the standards prescribed by the TEI P5 guidelines.

The repository includes, as three separate files, a critical introduction, the text of <em>Little Wars</em>, and a streamlined ruleset.
